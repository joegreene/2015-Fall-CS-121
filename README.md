__Extra Information__:
- If you need to contact me my email is located at the bottom of this page (and all other pages in this repository). 
- I can also be contacted after class (I normally sit in the back, far left). 
- You can ask me any questions regarding the material presented in the SI.
  - This does not include questions such as "Why isn't my program working?" or "What's the answer for this problem?".
- Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Thursday evening and Friday evening. If you've come to check for updates on the weekly work, this means that the best time to check it out is either midday Friday (or if I'm really lagging, Saturday).

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!
