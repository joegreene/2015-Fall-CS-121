### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (10/13) and Thursday (10/15).

__NOTE__: The solutions posted in the solutions folder are just examples and your solutions should vary. 
I myself used `float grade`, `string name`, and `int id`, whereas the SI session on 10/15/2015 used 
`double grade`, `string name`, and `char sex`.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We decided to cover over last week's worksheet again, so please head to last week's (Week 7's) worksheet as a 
reference for what we worked on this week.

### Thursday
We worked on the worksheet that's in the worksheet folder for this week. Next week we plan on continuing 
our work on this worksheet.

__NOTE__: If you have the older worksheet designed for this week, there are no plans to refer to it 
at the moment. If you do not know what I'm talking about, ignore this note.
