__How to Use This Repository__:

As it is __extremely__ important that you guys get where this is, below is an image of the file listing:
![File Location Image](file-loc-help.PNG)

I post all my material in [directories](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/director.htm) of this 
[repository](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repository). Whenever I refer to files/folders 
in the weekly folders, they are always in the file listing (named according to their purpose).

__Meeting Times__: (if asked to sign-in at the door tell them you're going to my SI)
- Tuesdays:  1:00 - 2:15PM @ CASECS (CS-201; I'll be at the whiteboard, middle table)
- Thursdays: 1:00 - 2:15PM @ CASECS (CS-201; I'll be at the whiteboard, middle table)

__Extra Information__:
- If you need to contact me my email is located at the bottom of this page (and all other pages in this repository). 
- I can also be contacted after class (I sit in the back). 
- You can ask me any questions about the course as long as they are not homework related.
- All updates to this repository are done between Thursday evening and Friday night. 
  - The best time to check for updates is either midday Friday (or if I'm really lagging, Saturday).

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!
