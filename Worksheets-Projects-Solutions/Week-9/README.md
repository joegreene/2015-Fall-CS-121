### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (10/20) and Thursday (10/22).

__NOTE__: The solutions posted in the solutions folder are just examples and your solutions should vary. 
I myself used `float grade`, `string name`, and `int id`, whereas the SI session on 10/15/2015 used 
`double grade`, `string name`, and `char sex`.

__NOTE 2__: In the `infile` folder is an example of using ifstream on a list of integers and 
initializing it via a text file. Comments are left to explain the code, and I highly encourage 
running the work. Remember to have `data-file.txt` in your project folder as well.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

#### Trying File IO With XCode
I don't know if this is the best solution for doing this, but it works.

1. Open your XCode project (and compile some code in it so you have a runnable executable).
2. In the project explorer (on the right) expand the `Products` folder (the arrow should be pointing down).
3. Right click the executable listed under `Products` and click `Show in Finder`.
4. You should be in a `Debug` or `Release` folder. Paste your data text file (e.g. `FileArray.txt`) into this folder.
5. Building and running your program should work now (with file input/output).*

* Make sure to type the name of your file (including the `.txt` extension or whatever you set it as) or 
else your program will complain that the file does not exist or is inaccessible. It is case-sensitive.

### Tuesday
We created the program in the `infile` folder and postponed the worksheet for Thursday.

### Thursday
We worked on the worksheet for this week.
