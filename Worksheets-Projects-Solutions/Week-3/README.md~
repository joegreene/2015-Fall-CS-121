### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (09/08) and Thursday (09/10).

I found a small error with the February case of the week 3 worksheet (first problem). It's a small 
error and shouldn't be a big issue. I added the change to the online worksheet so everything should 
be fine.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
Worked on week 3 worksheet (did code cleaning section).

### Thursday
Worked on week 3 worksheet (did palindrome section).
