### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (10/20) and Thursday (10/22).

__NOTE__: The solutions posted in the solutions folder are just examples and your solutions should vary. 
I myself used `float grade`, `string name`, and `int id`, whereas the SI session on 10/15/2015 used 
`double grade`, `string name`, and `char sex`.

__NOTE 2__: In the `infile` folder is an example of using ifstream on a list of integers and 
initializing it via a text file. Comments are left to explain the code, and I highly encourage 
running the work. Remember to have `data-file.txt` in your project folder as well.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We created the program in the `infile` folder and postponed the worksheet for Thursday.

### Thursday
