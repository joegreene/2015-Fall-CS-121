Helpful Stuff Section
=====================

This section of the repository is for listing anything I find that might be considerably useful for you guys. The list is 
tentative as I'll probably find more useful items during the semester as well.

All links/items will be included in grouped sections below, alphabetically.

Apple Apps:
- [__CppCode__](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cppcode-offline-c-c++-ide/id936694712?mt=8): A C++ IDE & compiler for IOS users. Only really use this if you like programming on an iPad.

Android Apps:
- [__Aiuto__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.nishitp.aiuto&hl=en): A reference manual for languages such as C++, Java, etc.
- [__CppDroid__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.cppdroid&hl=en): A C++ IDE & compiler for Android. Only really use this if you like programming on an Android tablet.

IDEs & Compilers* (note at bottom):
- [__CodeBlocks__](http://www.codeblocks.org/): Somewhat minimalistic. Not much personal experience with this, but it includes g++ (mentioned below)
- [__g++__](http://www.horstmann.com/bigcpp/help/gnuwindows/): Terminal-based and super minimalistic; set it up as a challenge. Mac OS X users should install [__XCode__](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (comes with g++), and Linux users run `sudo apt-get build-essential` in a terminal window
- [__Visual Studio Express__](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx): I prefer 2010/2012 myself, although I'm certain we will work with 2013 unfortunately
- [__XCode__](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): For Mac OS X users. Great IDE from what I've seen and heard.

Text Editors (mostly for those working outside of an IDE like Visual Studio or XCode):
- Anything with the ability to show line numbers (and syntax highlighting) pretty much
- [__Emacs__](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/): If you're up for the challenge; great payoff
- [__GEdit__](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit): Great text editor overall (for Linux/Mac/Windows)
- [__Notepad++__](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): I use this all the time. Windows users should use this to replace notepad/wordpad
- [__Sublime Text Editor__](http://www.sublimetext.com/): For Mac OS X users; costs money but I heard it's worth the price)
- [__Vi/Vim__](http://www.vim.org/about.php and http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial): Another editor if you're up for a challenge as well; great payoff

Miscellaneous Reference Websites:
- [__CPlusPlus.com__](http://www.cplusplus.com/): Can get technical, however has many examples per reference
- [__CProgramming.com__](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html): Same idea as CPlusPlus but holds your hand a bit more
- [__OpenDataStructures__](http://opendatastructures.org/): Best reference ever for 131 
- [__StackOverflow__](http://stackoverflow.com/): Generally okay, however can be unfortunately unreliable at times
- [__Tutorialspoint__](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/): Straightforward tutorials and clean layout
- __Youtube__: There are plenty of tutorials on youtube as well. Some good ones are the Harvard open-course and MIT videos.

__*__ If you guys haven't yet, some schools in CSUF (e.g. computer science and ISDS) get select free software from 
[Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/). This means you can get software such as Visual Studio professional versions, 
Microsoft Office, and Windows OS for free. Ask the CSUF CS department (or whichever department you're under) about 
[Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/) if you're eligible.
