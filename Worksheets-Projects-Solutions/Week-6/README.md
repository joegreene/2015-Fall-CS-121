### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (09/29) and Thursday (09/30).

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We worked on the first worksheet for this week.

### Thursday
We focused on reviewing the project that was recently turned in (the card & rank guessing game).

There was a second worksheet prepared for this week, but we never really got to it. For that reason, the 
second worksheet will be put into next week's folder.
