### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (09/01) and Thursday (09/03).

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online website such as [www.ideone.com](www.ideone.com) (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We recapped last week's worksheet and talked a bit about how to create functions.

### Thursday
We worked on the worksheet for this week and talked a bit about program scope (i.e. what a 
function/variable can see in a program (all above and none below) ).
