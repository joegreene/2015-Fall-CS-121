  Questions/Problems:
  1. Fill out cfloatvector.h and cfvmain.cpp if you have not yet.
  
  2. On the right of each line that produces output, write out what its output would be.
  
  3. In cfvmain.cpp, are any includes required? If so, which? Explain your answer.
  
    
  
  
  
  4. What methods, if any, would you consider useful to include with CFloatVector?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  5. Give an example of how implementing the default constructor may look like.
