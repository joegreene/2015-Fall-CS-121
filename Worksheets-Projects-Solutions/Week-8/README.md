### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (10/13) and Thursday (10/15).

__NOTE__: The solutions posted in the solutions folder are just examples and your solutions may vary.

__NOTE 2__: I included an output file (`output.md`) to the solutions folder to represent my answer for question 2.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).
