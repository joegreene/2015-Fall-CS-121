Helpful Stuff Section
=====================

This section of the repository is for listing anything I find that might be considerably useful for you guys. The list is 
tentative as I'll probably find more useful items during the semester as well.

All links/items will be included in grouped sections below, alphabetically.

Apple Apps:
- No idea since I don't own an iPhone. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Android Apps:
- Aiuto (reference manual): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.nishitp.aiuto&hl=en
- CppDroid (IDE for Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.cppdroid&hl=en

IDEs & Compilers__*__ (note at bottom):
- CodeBlocks (somewhat minimalistic): http://www.codeblocks.org/
- g++ (terminal-based and super minimalistic; set it up as a challenge): http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/112/resources/installingEclipse/cygwin/ and http://www.horstmann.com/bigcpp/help/gnuwindows/
- Visual Studio Express (I prefer 2010/2012 myself, although we might work with 2013): https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx
- XCode (for apple users): https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

Text Editors (mostly for those working outside of an IDE like Visual Studio or XCode):
- Anything with the ability to show line numbers (and syntax highlighting)
- Emacs (if you're up for the challenge; great payoff): http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/
- Notepad++ (windows users should use this to replace notepad/wordpad): https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
- Sublime Text Editor (for apple users; costs money but I heard it's worth the price): http://www.sublimetext.com/
- Vi/Vim (if you're up for a challenge as well; great payoff): http://www.vim.org/about.php and http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial

Miscellaneous Reference Websites:
- CPlusPlus.com (can get technical, comes with examples on references): http://www.cplusplus.com/
- CProgramming.com (same idea as CPlusPlus but holds your hand a bit more): http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html
- OpenDataStructures (best reference ever for 131): http://opendatastructures.org/
- StackOverflow (unfortunately can be unreliable at times): http://stackoverflow.com/
- Tutorialspoint (straightforward and clean layout): http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/
- Youtube: There are plenty of tutorials on youtube as well. Some good ones are the Harvard open-course and MIT videos.

__*__ If you guys haven't yet, some schools in CSUF (e.g. computer science and ISDS) get select free software from 
[Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/). This means you can get software such as Visual Studio professional versions, 
Microsoft Office, and Windows OS for free. Ask the CSUF CS department (or whichever department you're under) about 
[Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/) if you're eligible.
