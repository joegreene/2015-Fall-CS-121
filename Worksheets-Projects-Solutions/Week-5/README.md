### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (09/22) and Thursday (09/24).

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We worked on the first worksheet for this week.

### Thursday
We reviewed the study sheet Dr. Siska posted online (prior to the exam).
