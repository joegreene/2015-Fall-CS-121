### Intro
This week is mostly preparation for finals and the final project.

Unlike other weeks, there is a section called [References](#references) which consists of (hopefully) helpful
links you guys may refer to while covering topics regarding this course.

Like other weeks, listed below are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (12/1) and Thursday (12/3).

### References
If anyone would like more topics added to this list, let me know please and I'll add them.

Worksheets (that I have posted either this semester or in a previous semester):
- Linked Lists
  - Check out the Exercises folder for this week (you could rename the terminology in the files and you have a minimal Linked List)
    - Terms to convert (if you want to make it look more like a LinkedList):
      - `TrainCar` --> Node
      - `Train` --> LinkedList
      - `engine` --> head
      - `attach` --> add (or push)
      - `detachLast` --> remove (or pop)
      - `noCars` --> isEmpty
      - `printTrain` --> printList
      - `car_id` --> contents (this is a general term for it)
- `this`
  - TBD
- Operator overloading
  - TBD
- Copy Constructors
  - Week 7's Worksheet has this in it.
- Inheritance
  - TBD
- Overriding Base Class Methods (i.e. polymorphism)
  - TBD
