### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (10/06) and Thursday (10/08).

__NOTE__: I included an `Alternate-Representations` folder to this week's work to show you guys 
how to define the `FCylinder` class inside a header file only (`FCylinder-mix.h`), and how to 
define the `FCylinder` class inside the `.cpp` file with `main` (`fcyl-main-aio.cpp`, where `aio` 
means "all-in-one").

__NOTE 2__: If you want to run the solutions files in Visual Studio or whichever IDE or standalone compiler you use, make sure all three files are included in your project's work directory (i.e. where you create files and run them). 

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
Worked on the worksheet and discussed a few questions about last week's lecture (on classes)

### Thursday
TODO
