### Intro
Listed are the activities worked on during the SI class on Tuesday (09/15) and Thursday (09/17).

__BIG NOTE__: I've included a tutorial on how memoization works, under the "Memo Tutorial" folder on 
this page. It goes over memoization with a factorial function.

To make the most out of the program solutions I provide, compile the actual programs through your 
favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), stand-alone compiler (if you use one, e.g. g++), or by an 
online compiler such as www.ideone.com (choose C++14 for the language to compile in).

### Tuesday
We went over the entire worksheet for this week.

### Thursday
We went over the second worksheet for this week. Not entirely, but enough to cover the entire session.
