- I can also be contacted after class (I normally sit in the back, far left). 
- You can ask me any questions regarding the material presented in the SI.
- You can ask me general questions regarding the coursework. Nothing specific like "Why isn't my program working?".
- I cannot (and will not) do your homework. 
- Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Thursday evening and Friday evening. If you've come to check for updates on the weekly work, this means that the best time to check it out is either midday Friday (or if I'm really lagging, Saturday).

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!
