Helpful Stuff Section
=====================

This section of the repository is for listing anything I find that might be considerably useful for you guys. The list is 
tentative as I'll probably find more useful items during the semester as well.

All links/items will be included in grouped sections below, alphabetically.

__Apple Apps__:
- [__CppCode__](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cppcode-offline-c-c++-ide/id936694712?mt=8): A C++ IDE & compiler for IOS users. Only really use this if you like programming on an iPad.

__Android Apps__:
- [__Aiuto__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.nishitp.aiuto&hl=en): A reference manual for several languages (e.g. C++ and Java)
- [__CppDroid__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.cppdroid&hl=en): A C++ IDE & compiler for Android. Only really use this if you like programming on an Android tablet.

__IDEs & Compilers*__ (note at bottom):
- [__CodeBlocks__](http://www.codeblocks.org/): Somewhat minimalistic. Not much personal experience with this, but it includes g++ (mentioned below)
- [__g++__](http://www.horstmann.com/bigcpp/help/gnuwindows/): Terminal-based and super minimalistic; set it up as a challenge. (link in title is for Windows users)
  - Mac OS X users should install [__XCode__](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (comes with g++)
  - Linux users run `sudo apt-get build-essential` in a terminal window
- [__Visual Studio Express__](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx): I prefer 2010/2012 myself, although I'm certain we will work with 2013 unfortunately
- [__XCode__](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): For Mac OS X users. Great IDE from what I've seen and heard.

__Text Editors__ (mostly for those working outside of an IDE like Visual Studio or XCode):
- Anything with the ability to show line numbers (and syntax highlighting) pretty much
- [__Emacs__](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/): If you're up for the challenge; great payoff
- [__GEdit__](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit): Great text editor overall (for Linux/Mac/Windows)
- [__Notepad++__](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): I use this all the time. Windows users should use this to replace notepad/wordpad
- [__Sublime Text Editor__](http://www.sublimetext.com/): For Mac OS X users; costs money but I heard it's worth the price)
- [__Vi/Vim__](http://www.vim.org/about.php and http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial): Another editor if you're up for a challenge as well; great payoff

__Reference Websites (Miscellaneous)__:
- [__CPlusPlus.com__](http://www.cplusplus.com/): Can get technical, however has many examples per reference
- [__CProgramming.com__](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html): Same idea as CPlusPlus but holds your hand a bit more
- [__OpenDataStructures__](http://opendatastructures.org/): Best reference ever for 131 
- [__StackOverflow__](http://stackoverflow.com/): Generally okay, however can be unfortunately unreliable at times
- [__Tutorialspoint__](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/): Straightforward tutorials and clean layout
- [__Youtube__](https://www.youtube.com): There are plenty of tutorials on youtube as well. Some good ones are the [Harvard OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-OxzIC6pic) and [MIT CS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM) videos.

__NOTE__: 
- If you guys haven't yet, some schools in CSUF get select free software from [Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/). This means you can get software such as Visual Studio professional versions, Microsoft Office, and Windows OS for free. Ask the CSUF CS department (or whatever your major department is) about [Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/) if you are eligible.
