Worksheets, Projects, & Solutions
===========

This is the main directory for all the activities that we have gone over. I fill out the "activity" parts after the SI session has occurred (because I won't know what we actually covered until the session is finished).

__NOTES__:
- The assignments and projects supplied here are in no way mandatory. They only serve to hone your C++ programming skills.
- I much prefer working on topics that you guys want to go over rather than assumption. If there are any ideas/questions that you would like to work on during the SI sessions, please let me know.
- On default I will make worksheets/mini-projects based mainly off of the lecture (or on topics that I consider need reviewing)
